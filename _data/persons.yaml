    Connor is a PhD candidate at the University of Arizona working on new records of past 
    hydroclimate and ecological change from lakes and bogs in Maine and Minnesota, developing 
    new statistical tools to improve inferences from these proxies, and synthesizing paleoclimate 
    and paleoecological records at regional to global scales.

    I am a paleoecologist interested in communities and ecosystems shifts in response to climate 
    and other environment changes since the last glaciation. My previous works are based on 
    paleo-terrestrial records (pollen, charcoal, LOI, etc.), dynamic ecological models and large 
    spatial climate data (Niche Mapper, LPJ-GUESS, CCSM3, etc.), and other statistical analysis.

    My publication record focuses on relationships between biotic systems and large scale 
    climatic change at time-scales of centuries to millenia, but my research efforts focus 
    on facilitating broader engagement with the tools and methods neccessary to build the 
    technical toolkits we require to move forward as a society.

    K Gajewski is a Professor in the Department of Geography, Environment and Geomatics at 
    the University of Ottawa, and cross-listed in the Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Biology 
    and Ottawa-Carleton Geoscience Centre. He is a paleoclimatologist who works on 
    quantitative reconstruction and mapping of past climates as well as understanding 
    human-ecosystem interactions over the past 15000 years. He also has a field/lab program 
    developing new multi-proxy records, particularly from the Canadian Arctic.

    I am a palaeoclimatologist interested in the quantification of past climates. 
    My work is primarily focused on developing statistical techniques that quantify 
    and integrate the major sources of uncertainties of proxy records (e.g. temporal, 
    climatic or taphonomic) to derive more representative palaeorecords of past 
    spatial-temporal climate variability.
