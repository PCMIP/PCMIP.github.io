    John develops Bayesian hierarchical models and statistical methods to answer 
    ecological and other scientific questions. John focuses on spatial, 
    spatio-temporal, and computational methods for prediction and inference.

    I am a paleoecologist interested in communities and ecosystems shifts in response to climate 
    and other environment changes since the last glaciation. My previous works are based on 
    paleo-terrestrial records (pollen, charcoal, LOI, etc.), dynamic ecological models and large 
    spatial climate data (Niche Mapper, LPJ-GUESS, CCSM3, etc.), and other statistical analysis.

    My publication record focuses on relationships between biotic systems and large scale 
    climatic change at time-scales of centuries to millenia, but my research efforts focus 
    on facilitating broader engagement with the tools and methods neccessary to build the 
    technical toolkits we require to move forward as a society.
