The Pollen Climate Model Intercomparison project is part of a PAGES and PalEON funded initiative, a two meeting cycle, intended to investigate the sources of variability among pollen-based climate models, understand the strengths and weaknesses of models, and provide a statistical framework for evaluating fit, mismatch and artifacts of the models under different paleoecological scenarios.

This website is maintained for work arising from the second PC-MIP project meeting, held in Calgary, Alberta at Mount Royal University, on February 21-23rd of 2018.

The work from that workshop, and the project management can be found in the [PCMIP GitHub repository](https://github.com/PCMIP).  There users will find details about datasets, workflows, analytic tools and *in prep* publications as they are developed.

While the code base is open to the public, we ask users and collaborators to follow the code of conduct.
